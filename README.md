# Linear Regression

A linear regression with one feature to predict profits for a restaurant.

## Problem Statement
Suppose a restaurant franchise is considering different cities for opening a new outlet.

They would like to expand their business to cities that may give their restaurant higher profits.
The chain already has restaurants in various cities and  have data for profits and populations from the cities.
They also have data on cities that are candidates for a new restaurant. 

For these cities, you have the city population. Can you use the data to help you identify which cities may potentially give their business higher profits?
